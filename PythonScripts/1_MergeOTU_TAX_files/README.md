## Merging OTU and TAX table outputs for several runs of the pipeline.

If during the execution of the pipeline, you executed samples separately and you want to assemble the different outputs of the OTU and TAX tables into:

- Download both merge_OTU_table.py and merge_TAX_table.py scripts that you can find in this folder.

- Then, you have to download all the OTU and TAX table files of each of your runs. Make sure that you put one OTU table on a folder and the other OTU tables on another folder so that the script works correctly. This also has to be the case for TAX tables, make sure to adjust the name of the OTU_table on the folder containing the rest of the OTUs, as well as TAX_table.

- Run this command on your terminal.
